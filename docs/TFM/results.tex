\section{Experimental Results}

In this chapter, I will discuss the results obtained using the system developed in this project. First, I will go over intermediate results obtained during development and discuss how these influenced the decisions I took, then present the performance of the final system on multiple scenes. All the experiments that will be presented have been performed on a system running Ubuntu 23.10, with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H, 16 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti Mobile GPU with 4 GB of VRAM and 2560 CUDA Cores running at 35W. The system configuration is relevant, especially the GPU used, as the performance of the renderer highly depends on the computational capabilities of the graphics card, and the size of some scenes may prevent them from being properly loaded into memory. For reference, most 3DGS publications use the NVIDIA RTX A6000 to test their implementation and generate results. That GPU has an FP32 performance of 38.71 TFLOPS, compared to the hardware I used which only achieves a theoretical maximum of 5.299 TFLOPS, and features 12x more video memory.
